                                We at Study Hall believe that each child is worthy of respect and in an inclusive and holistic environment, we work towards ensuring that each child feels cared for and imbibes values to grow into a sensitive, empathetic, thinking individual. Children are allowed to progress at their own pace and we find ways which help children co construct knowledge along with their teachers in democratic classrooms. This helps nurture children to grow up to be responsible democratic citizens of the country and the world.<br></br><br></br>

                                Ours is a school community that believes in the partnership between students, teachers and parents. An active partnership is the only way children can truly make any progress. Our philosophy is for us to realize - Who am I and how am I related to this universe and everything in it? Thus everything at Study Hall leads to this understanding.<br></br><br></br>

                                At Study Hall we are a committed lot who take pride in our philosophy and are dedicated to this noble cause.</p>
