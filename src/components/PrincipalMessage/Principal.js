                                Welcome to Study Hall - A Universe of Care, a place where we prepare children for life, in a safe, respectful, love filled atmosphere.<br></br><br></br>

                                Our deep focus has been to reimagine education, to make it socially and politically relevant. We are committed to helping our children learn about themselves - their relationships with their own selves and with the others. The child is not placed separately from the society she/he exists in but is seen as an individual who has many roles to perform - that of a democratic citizen, a contributing member of society who possesses the empathy to be aware of inequality, a heart that feels for others and a mind that finds innovative <br></br><br></br>

                                I am fortunate to be part of this knowledge hub since past many years and have felt and enjoyed the zeal, enthusiasm and determination of students as we empower and motivate them to be innovative thinkers and inspired learners. Thanks to our Founder Dr. Urvashi Sahni, an internationally acclaimed academician, whose guidance give way to any adaptive changes required from time to time.</p>
